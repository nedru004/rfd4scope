"""Data model shared by all readers and by everything downstream of them.

A reader (BindCraft 1 today, BindCraft 2 later) turns one run folder into a RunData. Later stages
(structure primitives, target frame, interface analysis, families, specificity, export) read RunData
and never re-open the CSVs.

Conventions
-----------
* Design ids are file stems without the _model{k} suffix (binder01_l77_s305024_mpnn4); backbone ids drop
  _mpnn{n} (binder01_l77_s305024). A backbone is one BindCraft trajectory and is the unit of a family.
  Ids are unique inside a run only: the global key of a design is (run_id, id), see DesignRecord.key.
* Metrics are stored with BindCraft's own column stems in the scale of the CSV, never rescaled.
  The scale of every stem is in METRIC_INFO. Missing values are None, not NaN.
* Residue numbers are construct numbers: the numbering BindCraft writes into its PDB files (target
  chain A, numbers 1..N as in the file handed to BindCraft, with gaps if a run deleted loops from the
  target). Binder residues (chain B) are numbered 1..Length. Mapping to UniProt or reference-structure numbers is the
  target frame's job (TargetConstruct.uniprot_offset is filled in there; uniprot = construct + offset,
  and the blobs' input_offset is its negative). Everything that crosses into the blobs is UniProt
  numbered (docs/CONTRACTS.md section 2); construct numbers stay inside RunData and per-design analysis.
* Paths are absolute strings.
