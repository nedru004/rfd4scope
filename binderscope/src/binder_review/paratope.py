"""Paratope analysis for campaigns built on a fixed scaffold (docs/paratope.md).

A nanobody, scFv, Fab or ankyrin-repeat campaign designs a few segments of one scaffold and leaves the rest alone.
Every design is then the same fold, so fold similarity measures the scaffold and not the designs. What varies is
which segments of the scaffold touch the target, how long the loops that were allowed to change length came out
and where on the target the binders land. This module answers the first two; ``families.py`` combines them with
the epitope spread into ``runs[].diversity_paratope`` (docs/families.md).

Where the regions come from. BindCraft 2 records which scaffold positions it was allowed to change
(``settings.filters.Scaffold_Sequence_Retained_Fraction.params.scaffold_edits``, surfaced by the reader as
``RunData.annotations["scaffold"]``) and which designed stretches may change length. That record is exact, so
there is no numbering by inference (no IMGT, no ANARCI, no HMMER): the designed segments are the stretches the
spec lists, and everything else is scaffold framework. Because the retained-sequence filter was mandatory at 1.0,
every position the spec does not list keeps the scaffold residue, so the invariant stretches between the designed
segments are exact anchors that fix each design's length offsets. A design is aligned by finding the one way to
choose the lengths of its variable stretches under which every invariant stretch matches; a design that matches
in no way, or in more than one, is reported as unaligned and never guessed at.

Grammar of the spec: ``<chain><start>[-<end>][*][(<lo>-<hi>)]``, comma separated. A bare or starred entry is a
fixed-length substitution; ``(lo-hi)`` marks a stretch whose designed length varies in that range. A token that
does not parse switches the analysis off for the run, with the reason in ``off_reason``.

Segment names come from the modality: CDR1 to CDR3 for a VHH, H1 to H3 and L1 to L3 for an scFv or Fab, and
"designed segment 1..n" for everything else (an ankyrin-repeat protein has no CDRs). Where the scaffold does not
fit the modality's expected pattern the module falls back to the numbered names and says so in ``notes``.

Everything here is computed from sequences and BindCraft's own ``Interface_Binder_Residues`` column (read by the
reader into ``DesignRecord.interface_residues``), so the contact criterion is BindCraft's, not Binderscope's
recomputed one. Region boundaries are the campaign's own edit spec, not IMGT or Kabat.
