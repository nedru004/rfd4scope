"""Target frame: judge a binder designed against a truncated construct as if it sat on the full-length protein.

BindCraft designs a binder against a fragment of the target (a construct: a stretch of the chain, possibly with loops
deleted). The frame places every design on the full-length reference chain by a number-matched CA superposition,
weighted around the binder (so the epitope is where it should be even when the rest of the fragment moved) or over the whole
target, and then asks what the fragment hid: the other subunits of an oligomer, the rest of the chain, the glycans, the cut
ends and the membrane. See docs/target_frame.md for the API, the definitions and the verification.

Conventions (docs/CONTRACTS.md)
  * Three numberings: construct (what BindCraft wrote, 1 to N, with gaps where loops were deleted), the author numbering
    of the reference structure and, when an accession is given, UniProt. The reference numbering must equal UniProt
    numbering then (checked by sequence); without an accession the reference numbering is the common numbering. The
    construct offset is found by sequence, never assumed. Everything this module returns for the blobs is numbered in
    that common numbering (called "UniProt" in the field names); construct numbers appear only where noted.
  * Every coordinate returned for a blob is in the reference frame (the reference chain). A transform is (R, t) with
    ``x' = x @ R.T + t``, the same as ``x' = R x + t`` for a column vector.
  * A frame is data: ``TargetFrame.meta`` (JSON-able) and ``TargetFrame.arrays`` (numpy). ``save`` and ``load`` write
    and read exactly those two, so later stages never recompute it.
  * Metrics only, no verdicts, in what goes to the blobs. ``verdicts`` exists for QA and reads the same thresholds as
    profile.checks.context (``DEFAULT_CONFIG["checks"]``, kept equal to the built-in default profile by a test).
  * UniProt, SIFTS and AlphaFold records are optional: without an accession the frame is derived from the reference
    structure and the construct alone (no domain strip, no named topology, no membrane plane) and says so in ``notes``.

    to N). ``runs``: {run id: RunData | RunSpec | {"hotspots": [...], "numbers": [...]} | [hotspot, ...]} with hotspots
    and residues in construct numbers; a run given by hotspots only is assumed to carry the whole construct.
    ``uniprot_acc``: the UniProt accession of the target, optional. With it the numbering is verified (construct against
    the reference chain and UniProt, reference against UniProt and SIFTS) and the topology, domains, glycosylation,
    disulfides and a membrane plane are annotated from the refdata cache (a missing record becomes a warning and the
    part that needs it is left out); without it the frame comes from the reference structure and the construct alone.
    The construct offset is found by sequence, not assumed. ``chain``: the chain of the target in the reference (None: the
    chain that carries the construct's sequence; the frame records which one it took and why, in ``meta["composition"]``).
    ``partner_chains``: what the binder is measured against besides the target chain. None or ``"auto"``: the other subunits, that
    is chains of the same protein that belong to the target's assembly, and the copies that the assembly's symmetry operators make
    from them when the file holds only part of the assembly; ``"none"`` or ``()``: nothing; ``"all"``: every other polymer chain of
    the assembly; a list: exactly those chains. Another molecule is never counted unless it is named, and ligands, ions, additives
    and waters never are (see :func:`analyse_reference`). ``assembly_id``: the assembly of the file the subunits come from (default:
    the first one that holds the target chain). ``reference_id``: the id the reference is named by in labels (default: the file stem).
    Raises FrameError when the files do not fit.

    ``reference_cif=None`` builds the frame without a full-length reference: the construct is the frame (chain A of the construct file),
    designs are superposed on it so that they share one frame, numbering stays the construct's, and nothing outside the construct is
    known. ``frame.reference_given`` is then false and ``context()`` returns no metric at all (see docs/target_frame.md, "Without a
    reference"). There are no other subunits, no sugars and no membrane plane, and the cut ends of the construct itself are unknown:
    an accession can still be given, for the numbering check, the topology and the specificity panel."""

    """Place a design on the reference chain.

    ``design``: a structure.Complex or the path of a BindCraft PDB / RFD4 CIF. The design's target chain(s) are
    superposed on the reference chain over the residues they share, matched by number (construct number + offset =
    reference number) with CA atoms; deleted loops and any other absent residue simply do not take part. ``fit``
    (default: the frame's ``geometry.fit``, "interface"):

    * "interface" weights every shared CA by its distance to the nearest binder heavy atom (``interface_weights``: 1 up to
      ``iface_full``, Gaussian beyond, never below ``iface_floor``) and drops near residues that deviate by more than
      ``iface_cutoff`` before refitting (``interface_fit``), so the epitope sits where it does on the reference even when the rest of
      the target moved against it (a hinge, a flexible loop). With fewer than ``iface_min_n`` residues near the binder, or no binder, the
      whole-target fit is used and ``fit_note`` says why.
    * "all" uses every shared CA with the same weight (docs/CONTRACTS.md).
    * "core" refits on the residues a trimmed fit keeps.

    ``Placement.fit`` is the fit actually used. ``Placement.rmsd`` is the RMSD of all shared CA under the transform used,
    ``iface_rmsd`` the one over the residues near the binder (weight at least 0.5), ``global_rmsd`` what the whole-target fit gives and
    ``core_rmsd`` the trimmed fit's own RMSD. ``load_kw`` is passed to ``structure.load_complex`` when ``design`` is a path
    (RFD4: ``target_chains`` and ``binder_chain``); ``n_binder_chains`` remains the BindCraft shortcut."""
